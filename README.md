# Economic Indicators in the Balkans (2010‚Äì2024)

This project analyzes and visualizes three key economic indicators in Balkan countries from 2010 to 2024:
- **GDP Growth (annual %)**
- **Unemployment Rate (% of total labor force)**
- **Inflation Rate (consumer prices, annual %)**

The analysis uses Python and its data science libraries to explore trends, compare countries, and study the economic impact of COVID-19 (before, during, and after the pandemic).

## ‚öôÔ∏è What the code does
1. **Reads raw CSV files** (GDP, Unemployment, Inflation).  
2. **Cleans the data** by removing unnecessary columns and converting it into long format.  
3. **Merges** the three indicators into one dataset (`Economic_Indicators_Balkans.csv`).  
4. **Explores missing values and datatypes** to ensure data quality.  
5. **Visualizes**:
   - Correlation matrices (overall + per country)  
   - Line charts showing trends of GDP, Unemployment, and Inflation (2010‚Äì2024)  
   - Combined plots with min/max values per country  
   - Bar charts comparing indicators **before, during, and after COVID-19**
